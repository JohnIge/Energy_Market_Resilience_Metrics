A data analytics project powered by AMDARI, a platform for data professionals to get projects to work on. The case study used in the project was Energy Enterprise, from 2012 to 2014 (Timeline of the datasets). The project developed a resilient plan for the several key challenges faced by the case study, such as fluctuations in energy demand and supply, poor infrastructure, and high technological limitations, amongst others. Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn were utilised in an interactive notebook to conduct the project. A video of me verbally presenting this project is available on YouTube.
